This it the code of Segnet semantic segmentation architecture with VGG-16 implemented with tensorflow by Aziza Zhanabatyrova.

The code is not finished yet.

It is developed as a part of the implementation for the master thesis.

The model can be trained from scratch/ from a saved checkpoint/ using pre-trained weights.

Th data is loaded into the memory partially, to avoid memory problem.
